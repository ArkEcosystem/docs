# How to Send an ARK Transfer?

Transferring ARK from your wallet is the most common type of transaction.

You can quickly send a transfer by clicking on the _**Send**_ button in the header of the wallet detail page. This will bring up a prompt, on which you can fill in the required information to create a transfer transaction.

Upon clicking _**Next**_, you will have to review the transfer transaction's details and decide whether to submit it, then discard or save it by clicking _**Send**_, _**Back**_ or _**Save**_.
