## ARK Transaction Fees

The fee associated with a transaction is awarded to the Validator who forges the transaction in a given block.

Though dynamic fees allow setting a custom amount, there is no reason to increase a transaction fee above the ‘average’ at this time.

A user may enter a lower fee if desired, though there is no guarantee the transaction will be forged.

Fortunately, rejected transactions do not forfeit the fee as with Ethereum and its "gas fee".

Since the ARK transaction failed and funds never technically left the user's wallet, the Desktop Wallet and APN (ARK Public Network) simply behave as if the transaction never existed.
