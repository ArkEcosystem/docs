## News and Important Updates

The Desktop Wallet has a dedicated section, showing news and other relevant updates in the ARK Ecosystem. Often, you will receive new blog posts in this section, which can be accessed via clicking the newspaper icon in the wallet's navigation bar.

## Changing the Application's Settings

There's a bunch of options for how you may customize the look, behaviour, and feel of the application.

### Network Options

Network settings can be modified by clicking on the cloud icon in the navigation bar; bringing up a side menu. In the Network settings menu, you may select another peer to use for fetching transaction and wallet updates. Also, the menu offers some valuable information about the network and advanced configuration options in the **Network Overview** section.
