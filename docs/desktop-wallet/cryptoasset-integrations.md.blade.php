## Integration Requests

We are currently not taking communnity integration requests. If you would like a specific cryptoasset to be added to the [ARK Desktop Wallet](https://ark.io/wallet), please encourage them to register at [MarketSquare](https://marketsquare.io) and reach out to us directly. 

We will add new assets based on a series of factors to include:

- Ecosystem Fit
- MarketSquare Participation
