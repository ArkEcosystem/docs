# Cryptoasset Integrations

The [ARK Desktop Wallet](https://ark.io/wallet) uses the [ARK Platform-SDK](/docs/platform-sdk) to allow the integration of multiple assets within the wallet. This document will outline the current list of supported assets as well as planned additions to our wallet.

## Supported Cryptoassets

The ARK Desktop Wallet currently supports the following cryptoassets:

- [ARK](/docs/platform-sdk/coins/ark)
- [LSK](/docs/platform-sdk/coins/lsk)

## Planned Integrations

The following cryptoassets are already in the initial stages of integration within the [ARK Platform-SDK](/docs/platform-sdk) and will be added to the [ARK Desktop Wallet](https://ark.io/wallet) upon completion.

## Integration Requests

We are currently not taking community integration requests. If you would like a specific cryptoasset to be added to the [ARK Desktop Wallet](https://ark.io/wallet), please encourage them to register at [MarketSquare](https://marketsquare.io) and reach out to us directly.

We will add new assets based on a series of factors to include:

- Ease of Integration
- Community Size
- Ecosystem Fit
- MarketSquare Participation

The ARK.io Team does not charge a listing fee and will not ask for Coins, Tokens, or other payment for listing. If someone is asking you for a deposit, you are being scammed.
