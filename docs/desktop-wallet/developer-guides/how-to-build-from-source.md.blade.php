# How to build the Desktop Wallet from source?

`Desktop Wallet version 2.x`

The official ARK Desktop Wallet is an open-source, cross-platform and MIT-licensed project maintained by the ARK Team & Community.

It is an Electron-based JavaScript app developed with Vue.js & Tailwind CSS using the Node v12 runtime.

The ARK Desktop Wallet's source code can be found at the following link: [https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/desktop-wallet](https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/desktop-wallet)

### Requirements

#### Ubuntu

Ubuntu requires additional libraries for kernel device management and hardware wallet support.

- `libudev-dev`
- `libusb-1.0-0-dev`

These may be installed using `apt-get`:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev
```

#### Windows

Windows additionally requires `Python 2.7` and `Visual Studio 2017`.

They may be downloaded and installed via the links provided below:

- Python 2.7
  - [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2718](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2718/)
- Visual Studio 2017
  - [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/)

#### Node 12

Node.js v12 is the supported runtime for the ARK Desktop Wallet.

Download and install the appropriate Node v12 package from: [https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/)

If `npm` is already installed, we may also run the following as an alternative:

```bash
npm install -g n
sudo n 12
```

#### Yarn

The Yarn dependency manager is also required and may be installed globally using the following `npm` command:

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```
