# An Introduction to ARK Rewards (Staking)

The ARK Public Network (APN) is a sovereign Blockchain with a native Cryptoasset called ARK. It is based on the Delegated-Prof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism and has 51 active Delegates (Validators) who secure the network. In this article, we will discuss how block rewards work within the APN and how you can earn a portion of the rewards by becoming an active delegate or voting with your ARK coins. 

## Block Rewards

The APN is a sovereign blockchain that is validated by 51 active Delegates. Each Delegate will submit (1) block per **round**. A **round** consists of 51 blocks. Each block on the APN has a **block time** of **8s**. Each block awards the active delegate who submits the block a **block reward** of **2 ARK** along with any **transaction fees** from that block. 

**Block Rewards** are inflationary coins, meaning the **total ARK supply** is increased by 2 ARK every block. This serves as a form of consistent inflation that reduces over time due to the non-fluctuating rate of rewards.

**Note: There are no "halvenings" of block rewards on the APN**. 

The block rewards and transaction fees serve as a form of payment for the service provided to the network on behalf of the voters who have delegated their influence to the Validator and entrusted them with the security and reliability of the network. 

On the APN, **100%** of the **block reward** goes to the **validator**. 

## Voting on the ARK Public Network

The APN uses a system of **voting** rather than **staking**. In order to vote for a Validator and delegate your influence to them, you do not need to *stake* your coins. This allows ARK holders to have more freedom and access to their coins while still allowing them to participate in the governance of the network. 

To learn how to vote, read our guide on [How to Vote or Unvote a Delegate](https://ark.dev/docs/desktop-wallet/user-guides/how-to-vote-unvote).

## Reward Sharing on the ARK Public Network

As previously stated, **block rewards** and **transaction fees** are awarded to the active delegate responsible for reporting a given block. We call this combination of the 2 ARK block reward and any fees the **total reward**. On the APN, many of these delegates choose to take a small commission from the **total reward** and share the remaining **after commission reward (ACR)** with their voters.

**This form of reward sharing is completely optional and not all delegates will share their rewards.**

Reward sharing can vary wildly with delegates taking commissions of anywhere from 0-100% of the total rewards. 

To find our more about the active delegates on the APN, view reward sharing information, or ask questions, visit [MarketSquare.io](https://marketsquare.io/delegates) where you can read their full proposals and contact them directly. 

You can also view current APN delegates with the official [Delegate Monitor](https://explorer.ark.io/delegate-monitor) inside the [ARK Explorer](https://explorer.ark.io/). 

## Becoming a Delegate

Some ARK holders want to be more directly involved and participate in the network themselves, rather than delegate their influence to a third party. We highly encourage anyone who is interested in becoming a delegate to read our full guides on [How to Register or Resign a Delegate](https://ark.dev/docs/desktop-wallet/user-guides/how-to-register-or-resign-delegate) and [Installing a Core Node](https://ark.dev/docs/core/getting-started/installation) to get started.
