## FAQs

**My sender and recipient wallets show mixed devnet/mainnet values** or **A 404 Error appears when navigating to the wallet.**

Make sure that `EXPLORER_NETWORK=` is set to the relevant value *(either `development` or `production`).*

---

**I updated my `.env` file but the changes do not reflect.**

You will need to run `php artisan config:cache` to clear the cache, followed by `php artisan horizon:terminate` to restart horizon to fetch the new values.

---

**I get a 500 Error when navigating to the Explorer.**

Check your logs by navigating to `storage/logs/laravel.log` and reviewing the information contained therein. This should tell you more about the exact nature of the problem and give you some indication as to how to solve it.

---

**Running `php artisan key:generate` results in an error.**

Explorer makes use of two databases, one of which is a local database for forging statistics where **SQLite** is the default setting. As such, you will need to generate a database by entering `touch database/database.sqlite`. If preferred, you may use **PostgreSQL** instead. For more information on how to set up a PostgreSQL database, click [here.](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createdatabase.html)

---

**The data I expected to see fails to load** or **I see stale data when navigating to Explorer.**

Ensure that you execute `php artisan explorer:cache-development-data` so that all the required data for Explorer is loaded.

---

**When attempting to view the Delegate Monitor, an error message appears.**

In a production environment, you will need to run `php artisan explorer:cache-delegate-wallets` in order to cache delegate usernames and assign them to wallets, and `php artisan explorer:cache-delegate-resignation-ids` to cache IDs related to resignation transactions - ensure that you execute both of these commands in order to avoid errors pertaining to the Delegate Monitor.

---

**How can I conduct a preliminary check when preparing Explorer for production?**

Before attempting to set up your web server, check that Explorer is working correctly by running `php artisan serve --host 0.0.0.0.` This will make it available on the serverâ€™s IP via port `8000`, meaning you can connect directly to it by entering `http://<your-server-ip>:8000` in your browser. If Explorer runs as intended, then any further issues that may occur will relate to your web server rather than something else in your configuration.

---

**Where can I find information regarding commands for a production environment?**

Click [here](https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/explorer/blob/develop/app/Console/Kernel.php) to view the `Kernel.php` file that contains all commands as well as how frequently they run. You can use these to ensure that your caches remain up to date.

---

**I have adjusted the parameters for my Core database but cannot get Explorer to work.**

You will need to set up a **Core database** before attempting to set up Explorer. Please follow the [Core Setup](/docs/explorer/setup/core) guide before proceeding further with your installation.

Alternatively, you may use **dummy data** for testing purposes by following the [Generate Placeholder Data](/docs/explorer/setup/development/#generate-placeholder-data-only-for-local-testing) section of the [Development Setup](/docs/explorer/setup/development) documentation.
