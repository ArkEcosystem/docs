***ARK Explorer 4.0 features several new improvements that make it far easier to navigate and locate important information. The updated UI greatly enhances the overall experience for end users and makes the latest ARK Explorer a great leap forward when compared with previous iterations. The following sections outline all of the new features integrated into Explorer 4.0 as well as the various page types and layouts. You will also find some helpful tips throughout to make your experience that much more enjoyable.***

## Homepage

ARK Explorer 4.0 possesses the same colors, typography and design elements that made the previous version great, but also features several improvements that significantly enhance the overall end user experience.

Firstly, the search bar is far more prominent than before and allows users to refine their queries via an **Advanced Search** option. As a direct result, locating relevant transaction information is much more efficient than ever before.

The next section features key metrics such as the current block height, total circulating supply, market cap and price of ARK (with relevant price history graph).

The most recent transactions appear beneath this section and effectively offer a snapshot of the latest activity on the ARK Blockchain.

In addition to the above, new icons allow users to rapidly pinpoint each of the various transaction types. Furthermore, a new **identicon system** provides each address with a unique graphic identifier, allowing for significantly improved navigation and user identification.

## Delegates Page

The Delegates page details all relevant information pertaining to the top 51 forging delegates. The very top of the page clearly displays the number of delegates currently forging (or not forging) as well as the number of missed blocks (if any). In addition to these, another indicator updates in real time displaying the forging round that is currently underway. Finally, the **Next Slot** indicator details which delegate is next in line to forge.

The remaining part of the page shows the name and rank of delegates as well as their forging status, number of allocated votes and overall level of productivity (calculated according to their general performance over the last 30 days). Users can also clearly see the current number of active delegates as well as those on standby and those that have resigned.

### Delegates Monitor

The inclusion of a **Monitor** allows users and delegates to view the current forging round's progress as well as the forging order for delegates. Many of the indicators here appear on the main Delegates page, but here users can check exactly when the forging of a block will occur and/or if the forging process completed successfully. The final indicator details the unique Block ID of completed blocks (the default Block ID for upcoming blocks is TBD). All information updates in near real time, meaning the latest data becomes available in a matter of seconds.

## Wallets Page

![](/storage/docs/docs/explorer/assets/features/wallets.png)

The Wallets page lists every wallet with a balance on the ARK Public Network in descending order. In other words, the wallet with the highest balance appears at the top of the list. The name and address of each wallet appears first under the **Address** column. Next, the **Info** column provides additional details regarding an address (for example, a wallet may belong to an Exchange, while in another instance, it may require one or more signatures to access).

<x-alert type="hint">
Simply hover your cursor over a given icon under the **Info** column to check what it represents.
</x-alert>

The total number of ARK coins within a given wallet appears under **Balance** while **Supply** indicates the total share of ARK coins that the wallet holds, expressed as a percentage (%).

<x-alert type="info">
Take note that the search bar allows you to search for a specific wallet address, meaning that finding a wallet, viewing its total balance and reviewing its most recent transactions is a simple and convenient process.
</x-alert>

## User Wallet Page

The User Wallet page details all the information relevant to a particular wallet address. Directly next to the address, two icons appear. The first allows you to copy the address to your clipboard while the second allows you to view the public address and copy it to your clipboard if you so desire.

Moving further right, the wallet's balance of ARK coins as well as its current value in USD (the default currency on Explorer 4.0) appears. To the far right, a blue QR code icon appears. Clicking on this brings up a modal which will allow you to send funds to the wallet by specifying a given amount and either scanning a unique QR code or selecting the **Send From Wallet** option.

The rest of the page details the entire transaction history of the wallet. It is also possible to view **Incoming** and **Outgoing** transactions in isolation by clicking on the relevant tab. Clicking on the **Type** dropdown menu allows you to further filter transaction types according to the following categories:

- All
- Transfer
- Second Signature
- Delegate Registration
- Delegate Resignation
- Vote
- Switch Vote
- Multisignature
- IPFS
- Multipayment
- Magistrate

The rest of the User Wallets page displays links to individual Transaction IDs, Timestamps, Senders, Recipients, the Amount debited or credited, the Transaction Fee and the number of Confirmations.

<x-alert type="hint">
Hovering your cursor over a **Timestamp** allows you to view even more precise data regarding the time of a transaction. Similarly, hovering over the checkmarks under **Confirmations** will display the number of confirmations for that specific transaction.
</x-alert>

## Delegate Wallet Page

![](/storage/docs/docs/explorer/assets/features/wallets-delegate.png)

The Delegate Wallet page displays much the same information as seen in the User Wallet page. However, further data appears at the top of the page. Under **Address Details**, you will see the delegate's name as well as their wallet address. In essence, the top part of this section is virtually identical to the information displayed under a User Wallet.

The additional information appears directly beneath this with the delegate's Rank/Status, Productivity (expressed as a percentage), Total Forged (the number of ARK coins forged by the delegate), Forged Blocks and total number of allocated Votes clearly displayed.

<x-alert type="hint">
Clicking on 'See all' under **Forged Blocks** navigates to a page that details the complete history of all the blocks forged by the delegate in question. Similarly, clicking on 'See all' under **Votes** navigates to a page that details all the addresses currently voting for a delegate.
</x-alert>

The following section displays 'Voting for (delegate's name)' as well as their Rank and current Status. The remaining information on the page is virtually identical to the data displayed on the User Wallet page.

## Aesthetic Enhancements

Explorer 4.0 offers two new features that allow users to customize their browsing experience according to their own requirements.

### Expanded Tables

![](/storage/docs/docs/explorer/assets/features/expanded-tables.png)

For Desktop users, ARK Explorer 4.0 offers expanded tables, effectively increasing the size of displayed items as well as the spacing between them. This allows users to enjoy a browsing experience that feels less 'crowded,' thus enhancing navigability and reducing eye strain (particularly for those users who may suffer from certain visual impairments).

### Dark Theme

For those users who need to spend countless hours checking and working with data on computer monitors (or those who simply prefer an interface with a lower lumen count), the new ARK Explorer features a **dark theme** that replaces the preponderance of white with a more subtle charcoal aesthetic.

While it may not form part of the many innovative features within the new Explorer, it certainly allows users to further customize their experience and make use of settings that reduce eye strain and general fatigue.
