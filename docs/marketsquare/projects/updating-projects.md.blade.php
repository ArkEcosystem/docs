# Updating Projects on MarketSquare

MarketSquare allows Projects to be updated by members with administrator access. The process is similar to Project creation, but with a few minor differences. If you have not already created a Project, please visit the [Project Creation](/docs/marketsquare/projects/creating-projects) page.

## Getting Started

To get started updating an existing project, navigate to its listing page and click '**Edit**'.

We can also select '**My Projects**' from the drop-down menu of a Project admin or team member account.

Next, click the '**Edit**' button next to the relevant Project, then select '**Edit Project**'.

### Platforms

Here, we can select up to 5 different platforms related to our listing. Platforms may be chosen from the provided list, or a custom platform can be added as well.

To enter a custom Platform, click '**Add Platform**', type in the desired platform, and click '**Save**'.

### Category

Categories summarize the key topics surrounding a Project and help to explain its purpose. Only 1 category may be selected.

Some examples include, '**Games**', '**Developer Tools**', or '**Storage**'.

After making a selection, click the ‘Save’ button to confirm the change.

### Tags

These can be anything that could help a user find or understand what a particular project is about, but are somewhat more specific and less hierarchical than a category or platform.

Type the desired tags into the Tags form, and click the ‘Save’ button to confirm the changes.

Up to 3 tags may selected.

### Description

The Project's description--just as in a MarketSquare Profile--supports markdown and is limited to 1,000 characters.
