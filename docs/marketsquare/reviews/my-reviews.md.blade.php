# My Reviews on MarketSquare

Reviews are one of the most important aspects of MarketSquare. They allow the opinions of the industry to be heard so other users are better informed about Projects and Properties.

## My Reviews

We can get a good look at Reviews left for _other_ Projects by clicking the Profile Avatar at the top of the page and selecting ‘**My Projects**’ from the drop-down menu.
