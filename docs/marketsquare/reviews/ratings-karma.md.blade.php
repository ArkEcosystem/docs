# Ratings & Karma on MarketSquare

Ratings and Karma reflect the social interactions a user or Project has made on the MarketSquare platform. These ratings are determined by up/down votes on comments, as well as by ratings left and received for a given Project.

## My Ratings & Karma

These can be seen by clicking the Avatar at the top of the page and selecting ‘Profile’ from the drop-down menu.
