# Handling Notifications on MarketSquare

Now that we’ve learned about updating our Profile, creating Projects, managing Teams, and working with Reviews, it’s time to take a quick look at handling Notifications on MarketSquare.

Notifications are typically received whenever we receive a comment on one of our project reviews, or whenever one of our projects receives a review. We will also receive a notification when a [Hub](/docs/marketsquare/getting-started/marketsquare-hubs) we are [following](/docs/marketsquare/notifications/hub-announcements) makes an announcement.

## Getting Started

We can view notifications by clicking the ‘bell’ icon at the top of the page next to our Profile Avatar. This will give us a look at our most recent notifications.

To see a full list of notifications, simply click the ‘**Show All**’ button.

## The Notifications Page

Here we can see all of the notifications in our inbox.

Clicking ‘**Take Me There**’ will redirect us to the relevant review or announcement.

## Managing the Notifications Inbox

The notifications inbox has several options for managing the messages we’ve received.

To the right of the page, we have quick notifications access to ‘**Mark all as read**’.

To the left, we have options to select all notifications or select them individually. This will allow us to either mark the selected messages as ‘**read/unread**’ or ‘**starred/unstarred** ’.

This is also where we can delete notifications we no longer wish to keep.
