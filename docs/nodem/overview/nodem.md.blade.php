# Nodem Overview

Nodem is a new utility that enables developers and network Validators to streamline the management of their ARK Core-based nodes and relays from a single, easy-to-use interface. Nodem is designed securely using ARK Core plugins to access predefined node endpoints and never has access to the server itself!

We created Nodem because working with distributed servers doesn't have to be difficult. We've seen first-hand how complex node management can be. The struggle is real, and intuitive tools just aren't available. With ARK standing as the '_Simplest Way to Blockchain_', we saw a big opportunity to simplify the node management process as well.

With Nodem, you will be able to manage all your nodes and work collaboratively all from a seamless interface that won't stand in your way.

## All-in-One Management

Nodem features a rich all-in-one management dashboard to view the status of your deployments in real-time. Receive alerts, monitor resources and view logs across multiple servers.

Looking at the logs has never been more appealing. With the ability to quickly switch and filter based on what you are looking for in the logs (as well as switch between Relay and Forger log-modes). Not to mention you can start, stop and restart nodes with just a click!

## Collaboration

Maintaining delegate nodes and relays can be hard work. Countless hours are spent ensuring the stability of a network and it can be a thankless job. Scaling is especially challenging when you're flying solo.

Fortunately, you don't have to go it alone anymore!

Managing Blockchain nodes no longer has to be a single-player game. Go faster and further by inviting Team Members, setting access roles, and building together with Nodem!
