# Nodem Production Setup

<!--
This needs to be split up in a few sections or pages, as thereâ€™s two main things you will need to do:
- setting up Nodem on a server, and
- installing the core-manager plugin on the servers you want to have added to it.
Setting up nodem will need two sections:
- one for development, and
- one for production

Production setup:
Here the main setup should refer to laravel forge (https://forge.laravel.com/) where the setup is pretty similar to the development one.
The only difference will be that you set your .env variables to production and to a different url.
There should also be a manual setup, where we have to explain how to set it up on a bare server with PHP + nginx + postgresql (see https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/deployment).
Setup doc should only cover the initial setup, then link to the next document for setting up their first user and how they can add others to it.
