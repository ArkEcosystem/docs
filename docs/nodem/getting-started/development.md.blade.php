# Nodem Development Setup

<!--
This needs to be split up in a few sections or pages, as there’s two main things you will need to do:
- setting up Nodem on a server, and
- installing the core-manager plugin on the servers you want to have added to it.
Setting up nodem will need two sections:
- one for development, and
- one for production

Development setup:
see the nodem readme (https://github.com/arkecosystem/nodem).
Can be kept rather short, as it’s mostly an average laravel setup.
Mention prerequisites, setup commands and the other things in the readme.
