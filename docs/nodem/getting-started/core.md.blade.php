# Nodem Server Configuration

<!--
Preparing core servers will require an explanation on how to prepare existing (or new) core servers to be able to interact with nodem.

This comes down to the following steps:
- Installing the core-manager plugin through 'ark plugin:install @arkecosystem/core-manager'
- configuring the plugin, can be done easily through 'ark manager:config' and following the steps.

The document should explain the different auth options.
Make it clear to the reader that if they want to see logs in nodem that they will have to add the core-manager plugin as an entry to their app.json file, putting it in the right process(es) depending on how they run their core instances.

Might suffice to link to the existing core-manager docs on https://ark.dev/docs/api/manager-api/getting-started#content-installation for this section.
See if that covers everything and otherwise add to it there to keep it all in a single place.
