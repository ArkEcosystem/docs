# Server Management

<!--
Server Management:
Explain that servers which are running core-manager can be added to nodem.

Explain the process of adding a server from the dashboard and which details are required and what each of the options mean.

Explain the available actions for servers that nodem is aware of (managing core processes, updating manager/core, etc).

Mention that logs can be viewed on the serverâ€™s detail page, but that these will only show up when configured (see getting started section).

Actions through nodem will be logged for a server to show which users performed which actions; of course this does not apply to actions handled on the server directly as nodem is unaware of those.

Statistics for server resources will also become available in nodem as those are fetched in the background on an hourly interval.

Servers can be deleted by going to the serverâ€™s detail page and clicking the delete button there.

Listed providers in the dropdown are only for UI purposes so you can see at a glance where your servers are; nodem support all providers as it interacts with an RPC from a core plugin and does not care about the underlying provider.
