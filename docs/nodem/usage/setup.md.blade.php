# First-Time Account Setup

<!--
Account Setup:
In order to start with Nodem, you’ll need a user account.
Since the accounts do not rely on mail server setups, they are a basic create-and-share (you as the original owner create accounts for others and give them a code to sign up with).

Since there is no owner yet, the first account will be required to be made through the use of a CLI command: php artisan nodem:install.
Explain the steps so they will have their user (owner) account afterwards.

At this point they can log in and start adding servers or users.
For inviting users it’s a straightforward process that needs describing: click profile > team > fill in the details of the person you want to invite > create > see a code that you can use for them.

Will be good to mention what the different roles can and cannot do.
