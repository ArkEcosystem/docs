# Server Management

After [setting up your owner account](/docs/nodem/usage/owner), you can log in and begin [adding team members](/docs/nodem/usage/teams) or server instances. Any ARK Core-based server configured with the `core-manager` plugin may be added to Nodem.

This page will serve as your guide to managing servers using the Nodem Dashboard and will provide important information along the way.

Owner accounts and Team Admins may:

* [add](#adding-servers) servers,
* [edit](#editing-servers) servers,
* [export](#exporting-servers) servers,
* [import](#importing-servers) servers, or
* [remove](#removing-servers) servers.

Additionally, all team members can:

* view existing servers and their details,
* view server [statistics](#server-statistics), and
* view and download [server logs](#server-logs).

Various [server actions](#server-actions) are also permitted based on the member's access role.

<x-alert type="warning">
**Don't Forget!** Before managing your Core Server with Nodem, it must first have the `core-manager` plugin [installed and configured.](/docs/nodem/getting-started/core)
</x-alert>

## Adding Servers

### 2) Enter the Details

Next, Nodem will ask you to provide details about your Core Server.

![](/storage/docs/docs/nodem/assets/usage/servers-add-details.png)

* **Server Provider** - Your Core Server's host
* **Server Name** - A memorable name for this server
  * Visible from the Nodem Dashboard
  * Can be changed later by Team Admins
* **Host** - The Host address or IP of your Core Server instance
  * Must include both address and port (e.g., `ip:port`).
* **Process Type**
  * **Separate** - Relay and/or Forger are run as distinct processes
  * **Combined** - Relay and/or Forger are run as a singular instance
* **Access** - Your Core Server's access credentials created while [configuring](/docs/nodem/getting-started/core#configuration) the Manager API
  * **Account** - A traditional username and password
  * **Access Key** - A traditional access token
* **BIP38 Encryption** - Whether your Forger uses [BIP-38 Encryption](/docs/core/deployment/forger#content-getting-started)
  * Only check this box if applicable
  * You'll be prompted to enter your encryption pass whenever you start or restart your server

<x-alert type="info">
Server hosts listed in the dropdown UI are provided for your at-a-glance reference. Nodem uses an RPC interface to communicate with your server's Manager API, which supports all hosting providers.
</x-alert>

<x-alert type="info">
Visit the [Core Configuration](/docs/nodem/getting-started/core#configuration) page for additional guidance and information on creating **access credentials**.
</x-alert>

### 3) Confirm Details

When you have entered all of your Core Server's details, click the '**+ Add**' button.

After successfully entering and confirming your Core Server's details, you should now see it in the Nodem dashboard ðŸŽ‰

## Editing Servers

Owner accounts and Team Admins may need to update the details of a server at some point. Any parameter may be edited, whether it be a server's dashboard name, host address, server type, or access credentials.

### 1) Select 'Edit'

Get started by clicking the '**Action**' button next to the server you'd like to edit, then select '**Edit**'.

![](/storage/docs/docs/nodem/assets/usage/servers-edit.png)

### 2) Update the Details

## Exporting Servers

Exporting allows Owner accounts and Team admins to back up a Nodem deployment's server configuration easily. This is good to have as common practice should your Nodem instance go down unexpectedly or if a migration is needed.

### 1) Click 'Export'

From the Nodem dashboard, click the '**Export**' button.

![](/storage/docs/docs/nodem/assets/usage/servers-export-button.png)

### 2) Download the JSON File

When you're ready to proceed, click the '**Download .json**' button.

![](/storage/docs/docs/nodem/assets/usage/servers-export.png)

You'll then be provided with a JSON file similar to the example shown below.

```json
[
  {
    "provider": "digitalocean",
    "name": "Server 1",
    "host": "http://***.***.***.***:4005",
    "process_type": "separate",
    "uses_bip38_encryption": true,
    "auth": {
      "username": "**********",
      "password": "**********"
    }
  },
  {
    "provider": "ovh",
    "name": "Server 2",
    "host": "http://***.***.***.***:4005",
    "process_type": "separate",
    "uses_bip38_encryption": true,
    "auth": {
      "access_key": "**********"
    }
  },
  {
    "provider": "aws",
    "name": "Server 3",
    "host": "http://***.***.***.***:4005",
    "process_type": "separate",
    "uses_bip38_encryption": true,
    "auth": {
      "access_key": "**********"
    }
  },
  {
    "provider": "azure",
    "name": "Server 4",
    "host": "http://***.***.***.***:4005",
    "process_type": "separate",
    "uses_bip38_encryption": true,
    "auth": {
      "access_key": "**********"
    }
  }
]
```

## Importing Servers

Exporting allows Owner accounts and Team Admins to restore [exported](#exporting-servers) server configurations. This is useful in the event that your Nodem instance needs to be replaced or migrated.

### 1) Click 'Import'

From the Nodem dashboard, click the '**Import**' button.

![](/storage/docs/docs/nodem/assets/usage/servers-import-button.png)

### 2) Upload the JSON File

Next, upload your [exported](#exporting-servers) `.json` configuration file.

![](/storage/docs/docs/nodem/assets/usage/servers-import-1.png)

### 3) Select Servers

Next, you'll be asked to select which servers you'd like to import from your configuration file.

Select your desired servers, then click the '**Continue**' button.

![](/storage/docs/docs/nodem/assets/usage/servers-import-2.png)

If the process is successful, you'll be shown a list of your newly-imported servers. At this time, you can now proceed to your Nodem dashboard.

![](/storage/docs/docs/nodem/assets/usage/servers-import-3.png)

### Import Errors

In the event that there was an error importing your servers, Nodem will provide you with some helpful warnings.

**Failed Connection** - Nodem will test server connections during the import process. If Nodem fails to connect to a particular instance, a red '_X_' will be displayed where you would otherwise select that server, and a warning banner will be presented. When this happens, try clicking the '**Retry**' button first. If the connection still fails, check that:

* your server is still running,
* the `core-manager` plugin was installed and properly configured,
* the host address is saved correctly in your `.json` file, and that
* the access credentials are saved correctly in your `.json` file

**Duplicate Server** - Duplicate servers are not permitted. When attempting to import a duplicate server, a yellow '_!_' warning will be displayed where you would otherwise select that server, and a warning banner will be presented.

Refer to the mocked-up image below for examples of what a failed connection or duplicated server should look like.

## Removing Servers

Owner accounts and Team Admins may remove a server directly from a server's details page. While this action is permanent, the server itself will remain unaffected and can be re-added at any time.

### 1) Click 'Remove'

From your server's details page, click the '**Remove**' icon.

![](/storage/docs/docs/nodem/assets/usage/servers-remove-button.png)

### 2) Confirm the Removal

If you're sure you wish to remove the selected server, enter the server's name and click the '**Remove**' button to confirm your decision.

![](/storage/docs/docs/nodem/assets/usage/servers-remove-confirm.png)

Afterward, the server will no longer be visible from the Nodem dashboard.

## Server Actions

Server actions are a quick way for Owners, Admins, and Maintainers to perform common server tasks directly from Nodem. Below are the available actions, as well as what Roles are permitted to perform a particular action.

Each action may be performed on a particular server's Relay, Forger, or both instances.

To get started, click the '**Action**' icon next to your desired server.

![](/storage/docs/docs/nodem/assets/usage/servers-actions.png)

* **Readonly**
  * _Not_ permitted to perform server actions
* **Maintainer**
  * Permitted to start, restart, stop, delete, and update servers
* **Admin**
  * All 'Maintainer' privileges
  * Permitted to edit servers

## Server Statistics

A server's statistics page provides an excellent overview of its performance and is updated hourly.

![](/storage/docs/docs/nodem/assets/usage/servers-performance.png)

## Server Logs

Logs are visible from a server's details page and lets your team to view its activity, including actions performed within Nodem by individual team members.

<x-alert type="warning">
Before Nodem can access and provide logging features, you must first extend process logging to your server's Manager API.<br>Refer to the [Server Logging](/docs/nodem/getting-started/core#logging) section for additional information and guidance.
</x-alert>

<x-alert type="info">
Actions performed directly from your server do not include user information as Nodem has no way to recognize this activity.
</x-alert>

### Downloading Logs

From a server's details page under either 'Relay' or 'Forger,' click the '**Download**' icon.
