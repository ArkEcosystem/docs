# Server Management

After [setting up your owner account](/docs/nodem/usage/owner), you can log in and begin [adding team members](/docs/nodem/usage/teams) or server instances. Any ARK Core-based server configured with the `core-manager` plugin may be added to Nodem.

<x-alert type="info">
Server hosts listed in the dropdown UI are provided for your at-a-glance reference. Nodem uses an RPC interface to communicate with your server's Manager API, which supports all hosting providers.
</x-alert>

## Adding Servers

<!--
TODO: Explain the process of adding a server from the dashboard and which details are required and what each of the options mean.
-->

## Server Actions

<!--
TODO: Explain the available actions for servers that nodem is aware of (managing core processes, updating manager/core, etc).
-->

## Server Logs

<!--
TODO: Mention that logs can be viewed on the server’s detail page, but that these will only show up when configured (see getting started section).

Actions through nodem will be logged for a server to show which users performed which actions; of course this does not apply to actions handled on the server directly as nodem is unaware of those.

Statistics for server resources will also become available in nodem as those are fetched in the background on an hourly interval.
-->

## Removing a Server

Servers may be removed by navigating to the server’s detail page and clicking the 'delete' button.
