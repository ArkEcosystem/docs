# Team Management

With Nodem, you can work collaboratively by inviting team members and setting access roles from a simple and intuitive interface. Managing your Core Servers has never been easier!

This page will serve as your guide to the process of managing and maintaining your Nodem team and will provide important information along the way.

Owner accounts and Team Admins may:

* [invite](#inviting-team-members) team members,
* [remove](#canceling-an-invite) pending invitations,
* [edit](#editing-team-members) existing team members, or
* [remove](#removing-team-members) team members.

Additionally, new team members must [sign-up](#signing-up) using their unique invitation code generated by an owner or admin.

## Inviting Team Members

Owner accounts and Team Admins can add additional team member accounts using a basic create-and-share scheme--i.e., an owner or admin creates an invitation code that others use to sign up and gain access to the Nodem deployment.

### 1) Navigate to the Team Management Dashboard

Start by clicking on your profile's avatar, then select **'team'** from the dropdown menu.

### 2) Click 'Invite'

Click the **'Invite'** button on the Team Management Dashboard.

### 3) Enter the Member's Details

Enter the details of the person you want to invite.

* **Username** - This will be used by your new team member at sign-up and to sign-in to Nodem
  * It must:
    * be at least 3 characters in length;
    * contain only letters, numbers, and underscores (_); and
    * _not_ begin or end with a special character.
  * It will be visible in the Team Management Dashboard
  * It cannot be changed. If a new username is desired, the team member account must be removed, and a new account must be created

  * Only a team's owner or a team admin can modify roles
  * **Readonly**
    * Permitted to view servers and team members
    * Permitted to change their password or configure 2FA
    * May _not_ perform server actions (e.g., start, stop, add, remove, etc.)
    * May _not_ add, edit, or remove team members
  * **Maintainer**
    * All 'Readonly' permissions
    * Permitted to perform only basic server actions (e.g., start, stop, restart, etc.)
  * **Admin**
    * All 'Maintainer' permissions
    * Permitted to perform all server actions, including the import, export, and addition of servers.
