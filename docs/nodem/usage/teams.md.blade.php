# Adding Team Member Accounts

After [setting up your owner account](/docs/nodem/usage/owner), you can log in and begin [adding server instances](/docs/nodem/usage/servers) or team member accounts. Team member accounts are added using a basic create-and-share scheme--i.e., you, the owner, create new accounts and share a code that others use to sign up and gain access to your Nodem deployment. 

## Inviting Users / Creating Accounts

Inviting users is a straightforward process outlined below.

1) Get started by clicking `profile` and then `team`
2) Fill in the details of the person you want to invite
3) Click `create` to generate your new member's invitation code
4) Share this invitation code with your new member who will use this code to sign up
