# Specification

## Contracts

Each coin follows a strict implementation contract. All of these contracts can be found at the following links.

<x-link-collection
    :links="[
        ['path' => 'https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/platform-sdk/tree/master/packages/platform-sdk/src/contracts/coins', 'name' => 'Coins'],
        ['path' => 'https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/platform-sdk/tree/master/packages/platform-sdk/src/contracts/price-trackers', 'name' => 'Markets'],

    ]"

## Network Manifest

Each coin follows a strict implementation contract which can be incomplete for certain coins due to how they work or a lack of features. The missing or unsupported methods will throw exceptions and to avoid unwanted surprised we need a way of letting consumers of the SDK know that calling a certain method will lead to an exception.

### Example

Let's take the `platform-sdk-ark` network manifest as an example. It contains some information like the name and ticker but the important part is the `featureFlags` key. This key contains all services and their methods with a boolean value to indicate if a method is safe to call.

```

In the case of ARK it would be unsafe to call `IdentityService.keyPair({ privateKey: "..." })` because it would lead to an exception due to a lack of support for this specific way of retrieving a key-pair. Knowing that there is a lack of support for this feature before we even try to call the method will allow us to safe-guard our application against any unexpected behaviors for a certain coin.

An example of how the manifest would be commonly used is to check if a certain coin supports the `TransactionService.vote` method. Trying to call this for example for `ETH` would lead to an exception because voting is not yet supported for this coin.
