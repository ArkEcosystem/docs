# How to Navigate the Mobile Wallet Interface?

The Mobile wallet was built from the groundup to provide a simple but efficient user-inteface for anyone to use regardless of technical background. 

You can hit the triple bar in the top left corner, doing so will give you numerous options for you to select.

Choosing **Wallets** will place you at the main ARK Wallet balance screen. After you reach the main ARK Wallet balance screen, you can add another wallet, touch the triple bar on the top left corner, or choose an existing wallet to view even closer. If you want to add another wallet, push the blue circle we used earlier to create or import a wallet. If you hit the triple bar on the top left corner, you get numerous options where you can view and select:

* Main wallet balance screen
* Vote for delegates
* Change the peer to the network
* Enter the settings, where you may change or view your:
  * Language
  * Currency
  * PIN
  * Clear your Data
  * Privacy Policy

If you want to view an existing wallet and the transaction history, you will need to touch the rectangle\(s\) right below the **Total Balance** text.

* Register a Delegate
* Vote for a Delegate
* Rename your wallet
* Backup your Wallet
* Delete your wallet
