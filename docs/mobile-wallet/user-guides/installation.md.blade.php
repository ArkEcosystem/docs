# Installation

Like any useful application, you will be able to find the ARK Mobile Wallet application in your phone's store. It is entirely free to download and use.

Download the wallet from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mobile-ark/id1324625967?ls=1&mt=8) or the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.ark.wallet.mobile).

The application is built using the Ionic Framework, which enables the code base to be reused, keeping similar functionally and looks, for both iOS and Android.
