# How to Create or Import a Wallet?

## Creating a Wallet

If you choose to generate a wallet, follow the prompts and you should be shown your shareable Public Address and your Secret Passphrase.

<x-alert type="danger">
Keep your secret passphrase safe and secure, without it, you will not be able to restore your wallet, and you will lose all of your ARK tokens.
</x-alert>

After hitting **Next**, you will be asked to verify your Secret Passphrase. Your PIN will be required to encrypt your address.

The next screen will show you the amount of ARK tokens you have in your wallets, your shareable Public Address, the Market Value of ARK in USD, Satoshis, and the 24-hour Change.
