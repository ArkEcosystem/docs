# How to Vote for a Delegate?

To begin voting, we need ARK in our wallets. Once you've transferred ARK to your wallet, you will want to click on the wallet that was either imported or generated.

Once the wallet has been selected, hit the triple bar and choose **Delegates**. This will show you the top 51 Active Delegates and the delegates on standby
