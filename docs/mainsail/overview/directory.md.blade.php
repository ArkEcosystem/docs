# Directory Structure

If you're a developer and looking into contributing to Mainsail then this is the right starting point for you to get familiar with how it is structured.

## The `packages` Directory

The `packages` directory contains all of the official packages that are developed and maintained by the ARK Ecosystem development team. You should **never** add your own packages to this directory.

## The `plugins` Directory

The `plugins` directory contains all of the packages that you might be working on locally. You should **always** add your own packages to this directory.
