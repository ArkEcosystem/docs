## Option 1: Mainsail Core setup

The easiest way to get started with Mainsail is to use the official Docker image.

Follow setup instructions on the official [mainsail-core](https://hub.docker.com/r/arkecosystem/mainsail-core) docker image.

Alternatively, you can use the official Docker images for both Mainsail Core and Mainsail API.

Follow setup instructions on the official [mainsail-core](https://hub.docker.com/r/arkecosystem/mainsail-core) and [mainsail-api](https://hub.docker.com/r/arkecosystem/mainsail-api) docker images.
