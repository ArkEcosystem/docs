# Going Live!

Before going live with a new project or releasing a new version of an existing project it is important to ensure that all new features work as expected and old functionality is preserved unless it was intentionally removed or modified.

To make sure that everything is working as intended you should follow these checklists that are used whenever a project is going live or receives a new release. Having those checklists will make sure that you don't forget anything major.

**If you discover that something important is missing from the checklists send a PR to add it.**
