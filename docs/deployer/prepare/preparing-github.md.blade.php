# Preparing Github

During the configuration of your bridgechain using the ARK Deployer, you will be required to enter the details of your GitHub repositories if you want changes to be committed. Whether or not you want a public or private bridgechain codebase is up to you. This section will provide guidance on how to prepare your GitHub account for your bridgechain Core and Explorer. _This is an optional step but the documentation will have assumed you have done this._

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create an account for your project. You may want to use this opportunity to set up the official Gsuite or similar accounts for your chain, and create a GitHub account using for example `info@yourbridgechain.com`. The github username will be the main identity of your chain, so choose your bridgechain name such as `coolchain` as the username.
2. Go to the [ARK Ecosystem Core repository](https://github.com/arkecosystem/core) and select `Fork` in the top right corner.
3. Press the `Clone or Download` green button on your new fork and copy the URL provided. The ARK Deployer will ask you for this information later.
4. Go to the [ARK Ecosystem Explorer repository](https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/explorer) and select `Fork` in the top right corner.
5. Press the `Clone or Download` green button on your new fork and copy the URL provided. The ARK Deployer will ask you for this information later.

The Core and Explorer repos are now integrated into your new account and soon, your new blockchain will be able to communicate with them.

**Congratulations!** All the initial preparations for your new chain are now complete, and you can now move on to using the ARK Deployer for chain customization.
