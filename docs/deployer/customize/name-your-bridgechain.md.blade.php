# Name Your Bridgechain

The initial step of setting up your bridgechain configuration is to provide some of the essentials that will make your bridgechain unique and stand out. Fill out these fields wisely, as they will be a representation of your project to the outside world. Let's get started by going over the fields you need to fill in on this step.

## Bridgechain Name

Is the brand and mark of your project you are setting up. Choose something unique that represents your project- this is the name people will call your chain for the foreseeable future, so make it count. Bitcoin is "Bitcoin," ARK is "ARK," and so on. Your goal is to use a name that won't clash with another project, so we advise checking [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com) to make sure your name is unique.

## Ticker

Is the unique string of letters that are attributed to the token on your new network. Usually, it's comprised of 3 to 4 letters that can be found in the project name. For example, the Bitcoin ticker is BTC, Ethereum ticker is ETH, and ARK, since our project name is short, is simply ARK. Your goal is to use a ticker that won't clash with another project, so we advise checking [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com) to make sure your ticker is unique. If you must, you can go up to 5 letters, but projects using 5 letter tickers are pretty rare.

## Symbol

Is the character you will be using to represent the token on your network to the outside world. Symbols are usually \(but not necessarily\) represented with special characters. US Dollar is represented with symbol $, Bitcoin with Ƀ, Ark with Ѧ. [Check this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters) for a list of symbols you can use. If you don't find a fitting symbol, you can also use something as simple as the first letter of your project name.

## Mainnet Address Prefix

Is the leading letter or number prepended to every address on Mainnet. It is represented by a single letter \(a-z / A-Z\) or a single number \(1-9\). This is usually the first letter of your project for convenience. For example, ARK's prefix is A. Bitcoin addresses usually start with a 1 or 3. This acts as a checkpoint for developers and users to determine which network they are on. For example, a random address starting with A might not be the ARK mainnet, but something starting with J definitely isn't.

## Devnet Address Prefix

Is the leading letter or number attributed to every address on your Devnet. The same concepts apply here as to _Mainnet Address Prefix._ It is wise to choose a different one than Mainnet, by default this is usually a letter D which stands for Devnet \(of course if you choose D as your Mainnet prefix we suggest to use something else, can even be a lower case d\). The reason for making it different \(although not necessary\) is to not confuse users on your network.

## Testnet Address Prefix

Is the leading letter or number attributed to every address on your Testnet. Since this will mostly be used locally you can use whatever you see fit as in most cases, it won't be accessed by many people.
