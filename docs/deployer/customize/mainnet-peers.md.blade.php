# Mainnet Peers

Peers on the network are servers that will run your bridgechain nodes and will act as seeds. Seeds are servers which are defined as a first option when other nodes try to join your network. In this step, you have an option to add additional peers in your configuration file for Mainnet. Do note that the minimum amount of peers on the **Mainnet** network is **20**.

This is an optional step and you can add peers later when you decide to run your network on Mainnet.

By clicking on the `Add Server` button you can start adding your peer IPs. You can name them so they are more easily distinguishable \(names are not saved into configuration file, but just displayed here in the interface\). **Be sure to include your genesis node IP in the list.**
