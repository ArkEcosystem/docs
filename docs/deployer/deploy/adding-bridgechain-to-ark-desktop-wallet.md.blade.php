# Adding Bridgechain to ARK Desktop Wallet

## Adding Network to ARK Desktop Wallet

Since our genesis node is up with peers running, we can now add the bridgechain network to the ARK Desktop Wallet, which of course functions with the ARK Mainnet and Devnet, but can also work with your new chain.

First, let's get the wallet and add a network.

1. [Download and install](https://wallet.ark.io) the latest release of the ARK Desktop Wallet.
2. On initial install, you will be forced to choose ARK network. Choose ARK. You will add your new network soon.
3. Now that you're in the wallet with the ARK network, you'll need to add a _new_ network, your network.
4. Click the `Cloud` icon in the bottom left area, then `Manage Networks`.
5. Click `Add a new network`.
6. `Name` the network your bridgechain name. If you like, you can declare which net it is as well \(main, dev, test\).
7. `Describe` your network.
8. Enter `http://GENESIS_NODE_IP:4003` or custom Public API Port.
9. You will then be taken to a new page showing details about your network that have been called from the genesis node.
10. Click `Save`.

## Creating Profile With Your Network in ARK Desktop Wallet

Next, let's add a profile and link it to that new network.

1. Click the `Profile Image` in the bottom left area of the wallet.
2. Click `Add Profile`.
3. `Name` your new profile and specify other parameters.
4. Choose your new `network` as the network of this profile.
5. Choose `appearance` parameters. You may want to give the wallet a different look to let you know you are in a different profile from the ARK network.
6. Press `Done`.

**Congratulations!** You are now connected to your network in the ARK Desktop wallet.
