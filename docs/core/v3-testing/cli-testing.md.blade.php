# ARK Core CLI Testing

ARK Core comes packaged with a robust command line interface (CLI) which is an essential tool that enables any node operator to update, manage, or monitor their node installation without the need for external programs.

Throughout this document we will be testing each command to ensure that the desired functionality behaves as expected. 

To complete this testing, it is a requirement that you have a node configured with V3 installed. 

You can find a guide on how to install Core 3.0 on a server within this document below.
<livewire:page-reference path="/docs/core/v3-testing/creating-v3-node" />


Once installed, you can view the installed version of Core and a list of available CLI commands by typing the following in your terminal:
```
ark
```

## Core
This series of tests will test the `core` process commands. The 'core' process will run both your relay and your forger in a single process. You can start the core process with the following command:

```
ark core:start
```
- Run `ark core:status` to ensure that the core to check the status of your process.

<x-alert type="info">
If your `delegate.json` file doesn't contain a BIP38 or BIP39 passphrase, then an error should be displayed.
</x-alert>

You can view your `core` process logs with the following command:

```
ark core:log
```
- Check the logs to ensure that the process has started correctly
<x-alert type="info">
If your `core` process isn't running, then an error should be displayed. You can check the status of your `core` process with `ark core:status`
</x-alert>

You can restart your `core` process with the following command:
```
ark core:restart
```
- Check your `core` logs to ensure that the process has restarted successfully

<x-alert type="info">
If your `core` process isn't running, then an error should be displayed. You can check the status of your `core` process with `ark core:status`
</x-alert>

You can stop your `core` process with the following command.

```
ark core:stop
```
<x-alert type="info">
If your `core` process isn't running, then an error should be displayed. You can check the status of your `core` process with `ark core:status`
</x-alert>

You can run the `core` process in foreground with the following command
```
ark core:run
```
- Exit the process and ensure that it has stopped from running with `ark core:status`

## Relay

This series of tests will test the `relay' process commands. ARK Core allows you to run a relay as a single process without the forger enabled with the following command:
```
ark relay:start
```
- Check that the process is running with `ark relay:status`
- Check the `relay` logs with `ark relay:log` to ensure the process has started correctly.

You can restart your relay process with the following command
```
ark relay:restart
```
- Check that the process is running with `ark relay:status`
- Check the `relay` logs with `ark relay:log` to ensure the process has started correctly.
<x-alert type="info">
If your `relay` process isn't running, then an error should be displayed when running the `ark relay:restart` command.
</x-alert>

With 3.0, you can now share your relay process via [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). You can do this with the following command:

```
ark relay:share 
```
- Check that you can successfully resolve to an API endpoint with the ngrok URL provided. 

You can stop your `relay` process with the following command.
```
ark relay:stop
```
<x-alert type="info">
If your `relay` process isn't running, then an error should be displayed. You can check the status of your `relay` process with `ark relay:status`
</x-alert>

You can run the `relay` process in foreground with the following command
```
ark relay:run
```
- Exit the process and ensure that it has stopped from running with `ark relay:status`

## Forger 
This series of tests will test the `forger` process commands. The 'forger' process will run your forger in a single process independently of the relay. You can start the core process with the following command:
```
ark forger:start 
```
- Check the status of your forger with `ark forger:status`
- Check the logs to ensure your forger has started correctly and loaded the correct delegate with `ark forger:log`
<x-alert type="info">
If your `delegate.json` file doesn't contain a BIP38 or BIP39 passphrase, then an error should be displayed.
</x-alert>

You can restart your forger with the following command:
```
ark forger:restart
```
- Check the status of your forger with `ark forger:status`
- Check the logs to ensure your forger has restarted correctly and loaded the correct delegate with `ark forger:log`

You can stop your forger process with the following command:
```
ark forger:stop 
```
- Check the status of your forger with `ark forger:status`

You can run the `forger` process in foreground with the following command
```
ark forger:run
```
- Exit the process and ensure that it has stopped from running with `ark forger:status`

## Config
ARK Core CLI allows you to configure your Core environment (CLI, database & forger) by using the `config` commands. For the purpose of this testing, we will just test the database and forger `config` commands.
<x-alert type="warning">
Completing the following CLI configuration commands will overwrite parameters in your `.env` and `delegates.json` file located in `~/.config/ark-core/devnet/`. **Please backup your current files before progressing if required.** 
</x-alert>

To configure your database, run the following command: 

```
ark config:database
```
- You should now be prompted to configure a database. 
- Configure up your database with your own custom values
- Once completed, run `less .config/ark-core/devnet/.env` and check your database parameters have now updated correctly.


To configure your forger, run the following command:

```
ark config:forger
```
- Follow the onscreen prompts to complete a BIP39 configuration
- Once complete, run `less .config/ark-core/devnet/delegates.json` and check your delegate passphrase is updated correctly.
- Run the command again and complete a BIP38 configuration
- Once complete, start your forger process and ensure the correct delegate is loaded after entering password. 


## Snapshots
Core CLI allows you to dump, restore, rollback, truncate and verify your database. This series of tests will utilize the CLI to perform actions with your database. 

To create a full snapshot of your database, you can run the following command:
```
ark snapshot:dump
```
- Ensure the process completes without errors.
- Make a note of the filename of your snapshot. This will look like `1-5235743`

Once you have taken a snapshot of your database, you can restore the snapshot with the following command:
```
ark snapshot:restore --blocks snapshot

// example: 
ark snapshot:restore --blocks 1-5235743
```

- Ensure the snapshot restores without errors
- Start your relay and ensure your node begins to sync to the network correctly

To rollback your node to a specific block height you can use the following command
```
ark snapshot:rollback --height=blockHeight

// example
ark snapshot:rollback --height=5641500
```
- Rollback your node to a block height of your choosing and ensure the process completes successfully
- Start your relay and check that your node will now begin syncing from the specified block height that you rolled back to
