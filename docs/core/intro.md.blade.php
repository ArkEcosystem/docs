# Introduction

## Getting Started

The **Getting Started** section will introduce you to the basics of Core. This includes the installation process, configure it and how you can make sense of the directory structure before you dive in deep and start developing your own plugins.

        ['path' => '/docs/core/getting-started/directory-structure', 'name' => 'Directory Structure'],
    ]"

## Architecture

The **Architecture** section will introduce you to the most important concepts and internals that you need to understand to build plugins that are stable, easy to maintain and make the best use possible of everything Core has to offer to aid you in developing your plugins and making the process as smooth as possible.

    ]"

## Services

The **Architecture** section will introduce you to pre-built services that you will be able to leverage to speed up the development of your plugins. Each of those services aim to lessen the burden of maintenance for critical internals on your part so that you can focus on building the plugins you want and need to achieve your goals.
