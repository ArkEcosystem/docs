# Cryptography Overview

## Introduction

This section provides definition of common cryptography terms used through the ARK Ecosystem product landscape. You will learn the importance of your passphrase and how it translates to private key, public key and wallet address generation. We also explain some common encryption algorithms and encoding protocols.

## Passphrase

<x-alert type="danger">
The **passphrase** is the master password \(key\) for your ARK tokens. Every ARK address has its own unique passphrase. With the passphrase you can sign transactions to send your ARK or vote for a delegate.

Do not lose it, and do not share it with others, or you could lose access to your ARK tokens. If you lose your passphrase, or if it is stolen, there is nothing we can do to help you. **We CANNOT recover any lost passphrases.**
</x-alert>

A passphrase is a "key to the castle." It is used to directly calculate the [PrivateKey](/docs/core/transactions/cryptography#privatekey) of an ARK account and should never be shared, stored irresponsibly, or transmitted over the internet. The only person that should ever have access to a passphrase is the owner of its account.

We can technically use any word, phrase, or string as a passphrase which will result in a valid ARK [Address](/docs/core/transactions/cryptography#address-wallet) or Wallet; however, it is heavily discouraged as the security of an address relies on the randomness of its Passphrase. Humans are bad at creating randomness, and entering sequences of random letters and numbers isn't easy to do accurately.

To promote usability while also maintaining security, ARK passphrases are implemented using the [BIP39 Protocol](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki). Simply, it's a mnemonic sentence constructed via randomly chosen words from a large [wordlist](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/bip-0039-wordlists.md). From here, that sentence or "Passphrase" is piped through a series of hashing, curve, and encoding algorithms to derive a [PrivateKey](/docs/core/transactions/cryptography#privatekey) / [WIF](/docs/core/transactions/cryptography#wif-privatekey), a [PublicKey](/docs/core/transactions/cryptography#publickey), and subsequently [Addresses](/docs/core/transactions/cryptography#address-wallet) / Wallets and [Signatures](/docs/core/transactions/cryptography#signature).

};

## PrivateKey

A PrivateKey is a 256-bit integer represented by a 32-byte Hex-encoded string of 64 characters obtained via [SHA256 hashing](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/SHA-256) of a [Passphrase](/docs/core/how-to-guides/setting-up-your-development-environment/intro).

![PrivateKey Generation Steps](/storage/docs/docs/core/assets/private_key_nologo.svg)

To understand the significance of this large number, consider the following:

Passphrase:

```
"this is a top secret passphrase"
```

PrivateKey HEX \(base 16\) / SHA256 of Passphrase:

```
d8839c2432bfd0a67ef10a804ba991eabba19f154a3d707917681d45822a5712
```

PrivateKey DEC\(base 10 encoded\):

```
97932109907804210295451942024598204992707895659209392543371974078748689061650
```

The DEC representation is the "base 10" interpretation of our PrivateKey and gives us a little insight into the size of the numbers we're dealing with "under the hood". This large integer is also referred to as a "BigNumber" or UINT256.

### WIF \(PrivateKey\)

WIF stands for "Wallet Import Format", and is a BASE58-encoded PrivateKey prepended by a network prefix-byte \(`0xaa` for ARK Mainnet & Devnet Network.

![WIF Encoding](/storage/docs/docs/core/assets/wif_nologo.svg)

It's essentially a more useable/human-readable [PrivateKey](cryptography#privatekey) and should be treated with the same diligence with regards to storage and security.

## PublicKey

A PublicKey is like an ID or Passport. It is a mathematical proof of identity and is derived from a PrivateKey via ECDSA and SECP256K1 computation.

![PublicKey Generation Steps](/storage/docs/docs/core/assets/publickey_nologo.svg)

ARK also uses "Point Compression" to obtain compressed PublicKeys that are 33-bytes in length.

## Address / Wallet

An ARK address is shareable much like an e-mail address. It is the destination to which ARK tokens can be sent, and is obtained from a [PublicKey](cryptography#publickey) via a combination of RIPEMD160 hashing and Base58Check encoding prefixed by a single network byte.

Since an address is derived from a PublicKey, that means it is also mathematically tied to a PrivateKey and Passphrase.

![ARK Address Generation Steps](/storage/docs/docs/core/assets/address_nologo.svg)

### Network Prefixes

| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |

## Signature

A Signature is essentially proof that a message or transaction was "signed" by a particular [PrivateKey](cryptography#privatekey) / [Passphrase](cryptography#introduction).

Remember that this same PrivateKey also has a matching PublicKey. That means a Signature is computationally linked to its corresponding PublicKey using ECDSA and SECP256K1 standards.

![Signing Process Example](/storage/docs/docs/core/assets/signature_msg_nologo.svg)

ARK Signatures use DER Encoding.

## Algorithms

### ECDSA

[ECDSA](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm) is a ["Digital Signature Algorithm"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm) variant based on and ["Modular Arithmetic"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic).

It is a standard to sign and verify transactions/messages and Signatures using [Elliptical Curve Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography).

| ECDSA Equation |
| :---: |
| y2 = x3 + ax + b |

### **SECP256K1**

[SECP256K1](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Secp256k1) defines the set of ECDSA parameters used to produce output "deterministically", meaning the same input will always result in the same output. Additionally, no two inputs will ever produce the same output; It is also hard to reverse. This is known as the [Discrete Logarithm Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm#Cryptography) and is the basis for Curve Cryptography.

| Curve Parameters |
| :---: |
| a = 0 |
| b = 7 |

| SECP256K1 Equation |
| :---: |
| y2 = x3 + \(0\)x + \(7\) |
| y2 = x3 + 7 |

## Encoding

### DER

An ARK Signature is [DER Encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.690#DER_encoding) using [BIP66](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0066.mediawiki) standards.

Upon obtaining a Signature from the ECDSA/SECP256K1 algorithm, it will first be in its raw form known as an "r" and "s" value.

![Signature: DER \(X.690 : ASN.1\) Encoding](/storage/docs/docs/core/assets/signature_der_nologo.svg)

Signature \(r, s\):

```
(0fb4adddd1f1d652b544ea6ab62828a0a65b712ed447e2538db0caebfa68929e, 5ecb2e1c63b29879c2ecf1255db506d671c8b3fa6017f67cfd1bf07e6edd1cc8)
```

In our example, the "r" and "s" values are each 32-bytes in length. Each of the "r" and "s" sequence identifiers are also 1-byte in length. Additionally, the slots for the size of "r" and "s" each occupy 1-byte.

This means that the length of the "r" and "s" values is 64-bytes. The \(r,s\) section identifiers and their sizes occupy a total of 4-bytes.

The total length of our signature is 68-bytes \(`0x44` in hex\).

| Identifier | Size \(dec\) | Size \(hex\) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| r sequence | `1` | `0x1` |
| r size | `1` | `0x1` |
| r-value: | `32` | `0x20` |
| s sequence | `1` | `0x1` |
| s size | `1` | `0x1` |
| s-value | `32` | `0x20` |
| total length | `68` | `0x44` |

The very first byte of an encoded signature is the sequence identifier `30`.

To encode the \(r, s\) values, we place `30` as the leading byte, followed by the total signature length \(`0x44` in this example\).

We then place the sequence identifier for "r" \(`02`\), proceeded by the size of "r" in hex \(`0x20`\), proceeded by the r-value itself \(`0fb4adddd1f1d652b544ea6ab62828a0a65b712ed447e2538db0caebfa68929e`\).

Finally, we place the sequence identifier for "s" \(`02`\), proceeded by the size of "s" in hex \(`0x20`\), proceeded by the s-value itself \(`5ecb2e1c63b29879c2ecf1255db506d671c8b3fa6017f67cfd1bf07e6edd1cc8`\).

DER Encoded Signature:

```
304402200fb4adddd1f1d652b544ea6ab62828a0a65b712ed447e2538db0caebfa68929e02205ecb2e1c63b29879c2ecf1255db506d671c8b3fa6017f67cfd1bf07e6edd1cc8
```

### BASE58check

[Base58Check](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Base58Check_encoding) encoding is used to produce human readable/typeable text from a hash.

It is used to encode a [PrivateKey](cryptography#privatekey) and is also the final step to encoding an [ARK address](cryptography#address-wallet).

## Hashing

#### RIPEMD160

[RIPEMD160](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/RIPEMD-160) is a subset of the [RIPEMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIPEMD) family of [cryptographic hash functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function).

As its name suggests, RIPEMD160 hashes are 160-bits in length.

#### SHA256

SHA256 is a subset of the [SHA-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) family of [cryptographic hash functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function).

As its name suggests, SHA256 hashes are 256-bits in length.
