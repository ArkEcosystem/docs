# How to Secure Your ARK Node?

When running an ARK node, especially a Delegate Node, you should consider your server's security as your main priority. We assume you completed all the steps as outlined in the previous guide:

<livewire:page-reference path="/docs/core/how-to-guides/setting-up-your-production-environment/core-node-secure-setup" />

<x-alert type="warning">
During this guide, we will configure network and SSH parameters, which if improperly performed might permanently lock you out of your server. Ensure you fully understand each step before proceeding.
</x-alert>

## Security Through Obscurity

By outlining how to secure a node we're breaking a fundamental property of network security. We are telling people how we are defending our network. This breaks the security through obscurity\([Wikipedia Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity)\) rule. If all nodes were secured in the same way, a single exploit might compromise the entire network. It is therefore vital that you consider other sources as well to secure your node.

### Making Sure Our Server Is Updated

The first thing we're going to do is make sure we have the latest security updates for Ubuntu. Once everything installs, you will need to reboot to make sure all the upgrades applied adequately.

```bash
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```

```bash
sudo reboot
```

You may also consider having your server update itself automatically using a cronjob. A useful tool is [cron-apt](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutoWeeklyUpdateHowTo):

```bash
sudo apt-get install cron-apt
```

## SSH Security

### Edit Your SSH Config

Edit your `sshd_config` by running the following command.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

**file: /etc/ssh/sshd\_config**

```bash
# What ports, IPs and protocols we listen for
Port 22
```

Change the `22` to a port of your choosing between `49152` and `65535`. This is the new SSH port we will connect on. Since we are not using the default SSH port, it is crucial you do not forget what you choose, or you will not be able to access your server.

From now on port 22 is not usable for SSH connections.

**file: /etc/ssh/sshd\_config**

```bash
# What ports, IPs and protocols we listen for
Port 55555
```

### **Authentication Settings**

In the previous section, we had you create a new account for security purposes. You should never log in as root to your server after it has been set up. Our first security measure is going to be to disable root access altogether.

**file: /etc/ssh/sshd\_config**

```bash
# Authentication:
LoginGraceTime 120
PermitRootLogin yes
StrictModes yes
```

Change `LoginGraceTime` to `60` and set `PermitRootLogin` to `no`

**file: /etc/ssh/sshd\_config**

```bash
# Authentication:
LoginGraceTime 60
PermitRootLogin no
StrictModes yes
```

### **Disable X11 Forwarding**

Set `X11Forwarding` to `no`.

**file: /etc/ssh/sshd\_config**

```bash
X11Forwarding yes
X11DisplayOffset 10
PrintMotd no
PrintLastLog yes
TCPKeepAlive yes
#UseLogin no
```

**/file: etc/ssh/sshd\_config**

```bash
X11Forwarding no
```

### **Limit Max Concurrent Connections**

Scroll down until you see the following line and uncomment `MaxStartups`. Then set MaxStartups to `2`.

**/file: etc/ssh/sshd\_config**

```bash
#MaxStartups 10:30:60
#Banner /etc/issue.net
```

**file: /etc/ssh/sshd\_config**

```bash
MaxStartups 2
#Banner /etc/issue.net
```

### **Save Your Config File**

Press `CTRL+X` to exit the file, `Y` to save the file and then `Enter` to write to the file and return to the command line.

#### **Restart SSH Daemon**

```bash
sudo service ssh restart
exit
```

#### **Test New SSH Connection**

```bash
ssh user@yournode -p 55555
```

If everything was setup successfully, you should be reconnected to your ARK node. Replace `55555` with the port you chose when setting up your `sshd_config`.

## Install Fail2Ban

### **What Is Fail2Ban**

The basic idea behind fail2ban is to monitor the logs of standard services to spot patterns in authentication failures. For example, by finding many password authentication failures originating from a single IP, `whois` commands shortly after connecting over SSH or other known exploits.

<x-alert type="danger">
[Fail2Ban](https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) can reduce the rate of incorrect authentications attempts however it cannot eliminate the risk that weak authentication presents. Configure services to use only two factor or public/private authentication mechanisms if you want to protect services. :::
</x-alert>

### **Installation**

Install Fail2Ban and create local configuration file.

```bash
sudo apt-get install fail2ban
sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```

### **Configuration**

Find all the references that specify port = SSH \(typically in the SSH header section\) and change the port to the new one you selected in the SSH security section above.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```

**File: /etc/fail2ban/jail.local**

```bash
#
# SSH Servers
#

[sshd]
port = ssh
logpath = %(sshd_log)s


[sshd-ddos]
# This Jail Corresponds to the Standard Configuration in Fail2ban
# The Mail-Whois Action Sends a Notification E-Mail With a Whois Request
port = ssh
logpath = %(sshd_log)s

[dropbear]
port = ssh
logpath = %(dropbear_log)s


[selinux-ssh]
port = ssh
logpath = %(auditd_log)s
maxretry = 5
```

### **Save Your Config File**

Press `CTRL+X` to exit the file, `Y` to save the file and then `Enter` to write to the file and return to the command line.

#### **Restart Fail2Ban Daemon**

```bash
sudo service fail2ban restart
exit
```

## Port Knocking

### **What Is Port Knocking?**

Port knocking is a technique used which obscures the port you're connecting on to prevent port scanning by opening and closing it when you need it. We will use a series of ports to essentially "knock" and your server will open your configured port for you to connect on by listening for connection attempts on those ports in a specific order.

### **Disable UFW**

By default, UFW comes enabled with Ubuntu 16.04. If you get `ufw command not found` then run.

```bash
sudo apt-get install ufw
sudo ufw disable
```

You can verify that UFW is disabled by running `sudo ufw status` and get a response of `inactive`.

### **Disable All Incoming Connections**

```bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming
```

### **Enable Node Port**

Depending which network this node is for will determine what port you open here. For mainnet use `4001`, devnet use `4002`, and testnet use `4000` and public API which is by default located on port `4003`.

We don't want to open any more ports than required to operate securely so we will open P2P port depending on the network \(in our example for mainnet\) and public API port.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 4001/tcp
sudo ufw allow 4003/tcp
```

### **Install Knockd on Server**

```bash
sudo apt-get install knockd -y
```

### **Start Knockd Server on Boot**

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/knockd
```

We need to change `START_KNOCKD=0` to `START_KNOCKD=1`

**File: /etc/default/knockd**

```bash
################################################
#
# knockd's default file, for generic sys config
#
################################################

# Control if We Start Knockd at Init or Not
# 1 = start
# anything else = don't start
#
# PLEASE EDIT /etc/knockd.conf BEFORE ENABLING
START_KNOCKD=0

# Command Line Options
#KNOCKD_OPTS="-i eth1"
```

**File: /etc/default/knockd**

```
...
START_KNOCKD=1
...
```

Then press `CTRL+S`, then answer `Y` and finally press `ENTER` to return to the command line.

#### **Edit Config**

```bash
sudo nano /etc/knockd.conf
```

#### **Knock Ports**

Here we're going to pick our opening and closing knock sequence. Choose three ports between `7000` and `40000` for each opening and closing. Write these ports down. The sequences need to be different.

Modify your config file to match the one below with your own ports. We do not recommend just copying and pasting this config. Replace `7000`, `8000`, `9000` with your own choices.

Also, don't forget to replace `55555` with the port you chose for `SSH`.

**File: /etc/knockd.conf**

```ini
[options]
        UseSyslog

[openSSH]
        sequence    = 7000,8000,9000
        seq_timeout = 5
        command     = ufw allow 55555/tcp
        tcpflags    = syn

[closeSSH]
        sequence    = 9000,8000,7000
        seq_timeout = 5
        command     = ufw delete allow 55555/tcp
        tcpflags    = syn
```

#### **Enable Our Firewall and Start Knockd**

```bash
sudo service knockd start
sudo ufw enable
```

#### **Checking Knockd and Ufw Status**

```bash
sudo service knockd status
sudo ufw status
```

### **Install Knockd Client**

Install a client for your operating system to make knocking easier. There are even a couple of mobile apps you can use for quickly knocking on your server to open your ssh port.

After knocking your port will remain open until you send the closing knock sequence.

#### **Ubuntu 16.04**

```bash
sudo apt-get install knockd
```

#### **Alternate Clients**

* [Win32 Client](http://www.zeroflux.org/proj/knock/files/knock-win32.zip)
* [MacOS Client](http://www.zeroflux.org/proj/knock/files/knock-macos.tar.gz)
* [Debian Package](http://packages.debian.org/unstable/net/knockd)
* [RPM Package](http://www.invoca.ch/pub/packages/knock/)
* [Android Client](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.droidknocker)
* [iPhone Client](http://www.sungheroes.com/portknock/)

## **Troubleshooting and Testing**

Logs for knockd appear in `syslog` and will be crucial if you need to troubleshoot.

Run the following command on your ARK node server.

```bash
tail -f /var/log/syslog
```

Let us test our knocking! We set our SSH port, and we've enabled knocking. Now we need to check to make sure that when we send the correct knock that we open and close the port correctly.

### **Open SSH Port**

From your personal computer or mobile phone use the client you installed above or if you are running Linux install `knockd` by running `sudo apt-get install knockd` and use the following command to knock.

```bash
knock -v nodeip 7000 8000 9000
```

You should see the following logs appear in your `syslog`

```bash
Apr 17 04:02:18 node1 knockd: nodeip: openSSH: Stage 1
Apr 17 04:02:18 node1 knockd: nodeip: openSSH: Stage 2
Apr 17 04:02:18 node1 knockd: nodeip: openSSH: Stage 3
Apr 17 04:02:18 node1 knockd: nodeip: openSSH: OPEN SESAME
Apr 17 04:02:18 node1 knockd: openSSH: running command: ufw allow 55555/tcp
```

Running `sudo ufw status` should list your SSH port as enabled.

```bash
arkoar@node1:~$ sudo ufw status
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
2086/tcp                   ALLOW       Anywhere
4002/tcp                   ALLOW       Anywhere
55555/tcp                  ALLOW       Anywhere
2086/tcp (v6)              ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
4002/tcp (v6)              ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
55555/tcp (v6)             ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
```

### **Close SSH Port**

```bash
knock -v nodeip 9000 8000 7000
```

```bash
Apr 17 04:23:37 node1 knockd: nodeip: closeSSH: Stage 1
Apr 17 04:23:37 node1 knockd: nodeip: closeSSH: Stage 2
Apr 17 04:23:37 node1 knockd: nodeip: closeSSH: Stage 3
Apr 17 04:23:37 node1 knockd: nodeip: closeSSH: OPEN SESAME
Apr 17 04:23:37 node1 knockd: closeSSH: running command: ufw delete allow 55555/tcp
```

### SSH Connection Using Your Keypair

<x-alert type="danger">
If you do not copy the correct key to your server, in the right location, you will be unable to authenticate.
</x-alert>

If you are not comfortable managing SSH keys, you can continue logging in via a password, but it is less secure.

SSH keys should be generated on the computer you wish to log in from. Just press enter and accept all the defaults.

#### **MacOS / Linux**

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

Browse to your `~/.ssh` directory and check to make sure it worked. You should see the following files.

```bash
cd ~/.ssh
ls -l

-rw------- 1 travism travism 1675 Mar 28 12:13 id_rsa
-rw-r--r-- 1 travism travism  401 Mar 28 12:13 id_rsa.pub
-rw-r--r-- 1 travism travism 3764 Apr 16 23:15 known_hosts
```

Copy your key to your server

```bash
# Open SSH Port It Not Already Open
knock -v nodeip 7000 8000 9000

# Copy Key
ssh-copy-id -p 55555 user@nodeip
```

#### **Windows**

Windows users can generate their ssh key using [PuTTY Key Generator](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/putty/windows/puttygen)

**Copy your PUBLIC KEY to your Server**

Copy the contents of your `id_rsa.pub` file on your local machine to your `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on your ARK node server.

#### **Disable Password Authentication**

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

This file should look familiar to you as we edited it earlier in this process. This time we're going to disable password authentication. Set `PasswordAuthentication` to `no` and make sure that `PubkeyAuthentication` is set to `yes` and `ChallengeResponseAuthentication` is set to `no`.

**file: /etc/ssh/sshd\_config**

```
PasswordAuthentication no
PubkeyAuthentication yes
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
```

Save your changes by pressing `CTRL+X`, then respond with `Y`, and finally press `ENTER` to write to file.

#### **Restart SSH**

```bash
sudo service ssh restart
```

The next time you log in you should log right in without a password prompt.

## DDOS Protection With Cloudflare

In this section, we're going to setup Cloudflare and SSL for DDoS protection and security using Nginx as a reverse proxy.

### **Install Nginx**

```bash
sudo apt-get install nginx
```

### **Edit Nginx Config**

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

Paste in the following config, making sure you edit the `server_name` and `proxy_pass`. You may need to change `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key` if you name your files something different.

**File: /etc/nginx/enabled-sites/default**

```bash
# HTTPS
server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name node.yoursite.com;
  ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/ark.crt;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/ark.key;
  ssl_verify_client off;
  ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
  ssl_ciphers EECDH+CHACHA20:EECDH+AES128:RSA+AES128:EECDH+AES256:RSA+AES256:EECDH+3DES:RSA+3DES:!MD5;
  ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
location / {
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-NginX-Proxy true;
    proxy_pass http://localhost:4001/;
    proxy_ssl_session_reuse off;
    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    proxy_redirect off;
  }
}
```

Press `CTRL+X` to exit the file, `Y` to save the file, and `ENTER` to write to the file and return to the command line.

### **Cloudflare / SSL Setup**

Login to your Cloudflare dashboard and click on the `DNS` button.

![](/storage/docs/docs/core/assets/cloudflare_dns.png)

Then go to `Crypto`.

![](/storage/docs/docs/core/assets/cloudflare_crypto.png)

Scroll down to `Origin Certificates` and click the `Create Certificate` button. Keep this window open after Cloudflare generates your two keys.

![](/storage/docs/docs/core/assets/cloudflare_certificate.png)

Open Terminal on your ARK node server

We need to create a new folder and copy our keys to our server.

```bash
mkdir /etc/nginx/ssl
cd /etc/nginx/ssl
touch ark.crt ark.key
```

Copy the `PRIVATE KEY` to the file `ark.key` and the `CERTIFICATE` to `ark.crt`.

### **Start Nginx**

```bash
sudo service nginx start
```

If everything started fine, you should be able to access your ARK node API's behind SSL. Giving you the bonus of Cloudflare DDOS protection.

Otherwise, if you get any errors run the following command to troubleshoot nginx.

```bash
sudo nginx -t -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

### Conclusion

Your node is now very secure. With this setup, you can open and close your SSH port remotely using a secret knocking technique as well as sign in using cryptographic keys.
