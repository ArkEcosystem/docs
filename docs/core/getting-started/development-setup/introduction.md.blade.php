## Introduction

ARK Core is written in [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript), and it has been using [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) to manage the development and publication of its packages and uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) as execution environment.

This guide will take you through the basic steps of setting up a development environment. We recommend Linux \(\*.deb based\) operating system as the default environment. We officially recommend and support **Ubuntu** operating system.
