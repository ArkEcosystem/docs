# v3.0 Upgrade Guide

ARK `v3.0` is a major update **not backward compatible with `v2.7.x`**.

| Concern       | Difficulty    | Description                                                                                                                   |
| :-----------: | :-----------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Time          | **HIGH**      | upgrading to `v3.0` requires new configuration files and database migrations.                                                 |
| Complexity    | **HIGH**      | a full overhaul of the internals and plugin system which makes previous modifications incompatible.                           |
| Risk          | **HIGH**      | `v3.0` is not backward compatible with `v2.x` releases as it includes a full overhaul of the internals and new P2P server.    |

## Upgrade Steps

Upgrading from `v2.7` to `v3.0` is fairly straightforward if you follow the instructions. Even though we try to ensure backward compatibility \(BC\) as much as possible, sometimes it is not possible or very complicated to avoid it and still create a good solution to a problem.

**WARNING:** Upgrading a complex software project always comes at the risk of breaking something, so make sure you have a backup.
</x-alert>

### Notes

After upgrading you should check whether your application still works as expected and no plugins are broken. See the following notes on which changes to consider when upgrading from one version to another.

<x-alert type="danger">
**WARNING:** Do NOT run any of the mentioned commands with **sudo** unless explicitly stated.
</x-alert>

### Prerequisites

Check what node version you have currently installed by running `node -v` . **If this shows a version below 14, you will have to update this before proceeding with the installation**.

To do this, run the following commands:

```bash
sudo sed -i s/node_11/node_14/ /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nodesource.list
sudo sed -i s/node_12/node_14/ /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nodesource.list
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
```

When this is finished, you should see version 14 installed when you run `node -v` again!

### Step 1. Database Migration Script

Use `wget` to fetch the `v3-migrations.sql` script.

```shell
wget -N https://snapshots.ark.io/v3-migrations.sql
```

### Step 2. Apply the iptables script

Get and apply the iptables script for core :

```shell
wget -N https://snapshots.ark.io/v3-iptables.sh
bash ./v3-iptables.sh start
```

This will set up some basic iptables rules to protect your node.

### Step 3. Update & Start Core

<x-alert type="danger">
**WARNING:** The commands below will remove and reset your configuration files in `~/.config/ark-core/mainnet`.

**Please backup any configuration files that you may need later such as your `delegate.json`, `plugin.js` & `.env` files.**
</x-alert>

First, make sure that in your current directory you have the **database migration script** (where you created the `v3-migrations.sql` file).

Run these commands (adapt the `psql` command with your user and database, default DB password is `password`):

```shell
pm2 stop all
```

```shell
psql -U ark -h 127.0.0.1 -d ark_mainnet -f v3-migrations.sql
```

```shell
ark update
```

> *Backup your delegate.json file if applicable with the command below:*

```shell
cp ~/.config/ark-core/mainnet/delegates.json ~/delegate.json.backup
```

```shell
rm -rf ~/.config/ark-core/ && ark config:publish --token=ark --network=mainnet --reset
```

> *Copy over backup delegate.json file if applicable with the command below:*

```shell
cp ~/delegate.json.backup ~/.config/ark-core/mainnet/delegates.json
```

<x-alert type="info">
**Note:** If you had any other custom changes to your `plugins.js` or `.env` files, now is the time to re-apply those changes.
</x-alert>

```shell
yarn global upgrade
```

```shell
pm2 start all
```

<x-alert type=warning>
In your logs you may see repeat messages about connecting to your database such as `Connecting to database: ark_mainnet`. This is due to the database migration and can take up to 1 hour to complete depending on your server hardware.
</x-alert>

<x-alert type=info>
Each runmode (`core`, `relay`, & `forger`) now contains their own configuration for plugins. This configuration file can be located here: `~/.config/ark-core/mainnet/app.json`
</x-alert>

### Reporting Problems

If you happen to experience any issues please [open an issue](https://github.com/ARKEcosystem/core/issues/new?template=Bug_report.md) with a detailed description of the problem, steps to reproduce it and info about your environment.

## API changes

### `POST /search` endpoints removed

All `POST /search` endpoints have been removed, in favor of using the main index endpoint (for example `GET /transactions`) with url parameters. All the main index endpoints have been improved to allow searching (see below API improvements).

### Standardized wallet response format

Now wallet endpoints return wallet object following this format :

```json
{
    "address",
    "publicKey",
    "balance",
    "nonce",
    "attributes": {
        "delegate": {
            "username",
            "resigned", // this attribute will only be set if delegate is resigned
            // other delegate attributes
        },
        "vote",
        "secondPublicKey",
        "multiSignature",
    }
}
```

As a result, to get wallets based on a specific attribute, we have to use the full attribute path, for example :

`GET /wallets?attributes.delegate.username=mydelegate`

**Note that `isDelegate` does not exist anymore in the wallet response** : in order to check if the wallet is a delegate, you should check the existence of `attributes.delegate` and that `attributes.delegate.resigned` is either non-existent or false.

### `addresses` parameter was removed

`addresses` was a parameter used to search for multiple addresses at the same time. Now with the improvements in api, this special parameter is not needed anymore as we can simply use the `address` parameter like this for example :

`GET /transactions?address=AXGc1bvU3g3rHmx9WVkUUHLA6gbzh8La7V,AVLPrtx669XgvervE6A594poB613HG3mSM`

### API improvements

#### Filter by any field returned in the API response

Letâ€™s take an example, say we `GET /delegates` and we get this entry in the response :

```json
{
    "username": "protokol1",
    "address": "ATKegnoyu9Fkej5FxiJ3biup8xv8zM34M3",
    "publicKey": "033f6d89ad9f3e6dfb8cfb4f2d7fca7adeb6db15c282c113d0452238293bb50046",
    "votes": "302776200010000",
    "rank": 1,
    "isResigned": false,
    "blocks": {
        "produced": 13886,
        "last": {
            "id": "9630922981846498992",
            "height": 1150380,
            "timestamp": {
                "epoch": 112045656,
                "unix": 1602146856,
                "human": "2020-10-08T08:47:36.000Z"
            }
        }
    },
    "production": {
        "approval": 2.42
    },
    "forged": {
        "fees": "10000000",
        "rewards": "2777200000000",
        "total": "2777210000000"
    }
}
```

By just looking at the response we can create an API query that filters by any field, like :

`GET /delegates?isResigned=true`

`GET /delegates?blocks.produced=13886`

We can still combine (AND) different fields :

`GET /delegates?isResigned=true&blocks.produced=0`

#### Filter by a set of values for one field (OR)

Following the same example, we can also specify a set of values (OR) for one field using comma-separated values :

`GET /delegates?username=protokol1,protokol2`

And we can still combine with other fields (AND) :

`GET /delegates?username=protokol1,protokol2&isResigned=false`

#### Order by any field

Additionally, we can order by any field by using the `orderBy` parameter :

`GET /delegates?orderBy=rank:desc`

The format is `field:asc|desc` depending on whether you want to order ascending or descending.

We can combine this with the filters :

`GET /delegates?isResigned=false&orderBy=rank:asc`
