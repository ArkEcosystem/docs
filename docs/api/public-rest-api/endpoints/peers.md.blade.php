# Peers

The `peers` resource is much like the [node](https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/gitbooks-api/tree/9815499ca52e615b8de858160da915cd960e6ea3/public/endpoints/node/README.md) resource, but only exposes the IPs and ports of connected peers. Recursively traversing this API and its responses allow you to inspect the entire network.

## Endpoints

<livewire:endpoint spec="api/public-rest-api/endpoints/specs/peers/all.json" />
