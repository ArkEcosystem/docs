# Votes

A vote is a specific type of transaction (type 3). A wallet votes on a different wallet, which has registered itself eligible to become a Delegate. Wallets may vote for themselves.

> Users are often confused by the voting mechanism and the fee associated with a vote. A Delegate does **not** receive ARK from their voters, nor is the number of blocks they produce proportional to their voting weight.
