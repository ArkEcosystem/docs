# Transactions

HTLC - Hast Time-Locked Contracts transactions enable two parties to exchange tokens safely and securely at the protocol level, removing the need to trust an individual who could potentially be a bad actor and withdraw from a prior agreement once they have received their tokens.
Locked funds can be transfer to another party using claim transactions or refunded back after HTLC expiration.
