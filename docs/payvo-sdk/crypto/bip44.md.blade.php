# BIP44

The `BIP44` class provides methods to extract the numerical value out of any currency representation by normalizing the input and removing any locale specific rules like symbols and use of commas.

## Importing the BIP44 class

```typescript
import { BIP44 } from "@payvo/sdk-crypto";
```

## Derive a child wallet from the given mnemonic

```typescript
BIP44.deriveChild('scout mushroom doctor prepare identify obvious soccer stage sudden already brass december million wish flower');
```

## Derive a child wallet at the given index from the mnemonic and path

```typescript
BIP44.deriveChildFromPath(
    'scout mushroom doctor prepare identify obvious soccer stage sudden already brass december million wish flower',
    "m / 44' / 0' / 0' / 0 / 0",
    0
);
```

## Derive the master key from a mnemonic

```typescript
BIP44.deriveMasterKey('scout mushroom doctor prepare identify obvious soccer stage sudden already brass december million wish flower');
```

## Parse a path into all of its components

```typescript
BIP44.parse("m / 44' / 0' / 0' / 0 / 0");
```
