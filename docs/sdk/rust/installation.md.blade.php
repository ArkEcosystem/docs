# Installation

## Rust installation

Rust can be installed using `rustup` as described [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Other installation methods are available [here](https://forge.rust-lang.org/other-installation-methods.html).

## Cargo

> Cargo is the Rust package manager. Cargo downloads your Rust package’s dependencies, compiles your packages, makes distributable packages, and uploads them to crates.io, the Rust community’s package registry.

### Install Cargo

Cargo is shipped by default with `rustup`. Alternatively, you can [build Cargo from source](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo#compiling-from-source).
