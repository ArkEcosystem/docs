# Client

### Install package with Gem

Add this line to your application's Gemfile and then execute the command `bundle` in your terminal

```bash
gem 'arkecosystem-client'
```

Alternatively, install it from the command line.

```bash
gem install arkecosystem-client
```

## Development

1. Fork the [package](https://github.com/ARKEcosystem/ruby-client).
2. Clone your forked repository.

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<githubusername>/ruby-client
   ```

3. Next, move into the fresh cloned directory.

```bash
   cd ruby-client
   ```

4. Install your dependencies with `Bundle`.

```bash
    bundle install
   ```

5. Dependencies are now installed, you can now run the tests to see if everything is running as it should.

```bash
   # TODO: see how it's done in ruby, lot of ways it seems.
   ```
