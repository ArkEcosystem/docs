# Installation

## NodeJS installation

Alternatively you can install NodeJS through your operating system [packager manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

An excellent way to manage your NodeJS installation and be able to work with multiple version is to go through [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
