## NodeJS installation

NodeJS can be downloaded [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Alternatively you can install NodeJS through your operating system [packager manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

An excellent way to manage your NodeJS installation and be able to work with multiple version is to go through [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

## Yarn

> Yarn is a package manager for your code. It allows you to use and share code with other developers from around the world. Yarn does this quickly, securely, and reliably so you donâ€™t ever have to worry.

### Install Yarn

Instructions on how to install Yarn can be found [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

### Install package with Yarn

```bash
yarn add @arkecosystem/client
```

## Development

1. Fork the [package](https://github.com/ARKEcosystem/javascript-client).

2. Clone your forked repository.
