# Hardware Requirements

A Relay Node is a full node in the ARK network; it maintains a complete copy of the ledger \(blockchain\). These nodes serve as Public API endpoint, use an internal service discovery mechanism to locate other nodes and keep each other in sync.

## Recommended Hardware Requirements

* 4GB RAM
* 40GB SSD
* 2 Cores

ARK Nodes execute many query intensive operations. The most cost-effective approach for running a high-performance node is choosing SSD over HDD. Increasing the total RAM improves cache performance.

## Configuration Requirements

* Stable internet connection
* Access to multiple open ports \(actual ports may be configured\)
